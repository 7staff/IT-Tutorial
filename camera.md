## The Camera
If your image's aren't going to be made with a camera you can skip this. 

The camera is an important part of taking a picture. You can't enhance a photos resolution after it has been taken. So it is important that you get the best you can from the start.

Phones are portable cameras that people keep in their pockets. 
So it is important that you know what your phone camera is capable of if you are wanting to get the best digital images you can.

Below is a table of the two most popular phones and their specs. 

Let's Compare



|Phone   |iPhone X   | Galaxy s9  
|---|---|---
| Image Resolution   | 4000 x 3000 | 4000 x 3000   
| Front-Camera Resolution  | 7 MP  | 8 MP 


Both of these are equally good for phone cameras. I guess if you will be taking a lot of selfies then the Galaxy is a better choice.

Here is a photo comparison

I personally like the iPhone's colors better.


You have to be careful with what you do with these images. Sending them over text or email can compress the photo. When a photo compresses, it reduces the size... at the cost of the **resolution**.

When choosing a stand-alone camera, you want to look for one that has the highest Mega Pixels (MP). Also some cameras shoot in JPEG format, other shoot in raw and JPEG. 

JPEG compresses images which is a no-no when it comes to resolution. A camera that shoots raw gives the most flexibility when touching it up later because it doesn't compress it.
