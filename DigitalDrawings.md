## Digital Drawings

This section is for people who draw or design digitally such as on a phone, tablet, or computer.

When doing this you want to use a program that can create and edit **vector images**.

**Vector images** are images that don't get distorted when changing the size or zooming in. So it gives a lot of flexibility when it comes down to having the correct size of an image or going back to it later and resizing it so you can put it on a huge banner without distorting the image.

**Bitmap images** are made of small pixels. When scaled they lose quality. This type of image is inferior to vectors when digitally drawing or designing. If you had to blow up a bitmap image to fit a banner you would probably be able to see all the pixels, with sharp, non-smooth, lines.
