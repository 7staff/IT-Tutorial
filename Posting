## Where You Are Posting

**Instagram**

Instagram is a popular social media app where people share photos. Although you may think your life like photo will look amazing on the app, it may not. Instagram can compress your photos if you don't know this one key detail. **Upload at 1080p**. If you resize your photo to 1080p, you will experience little to no compression. BUT if you have a photo larger than that... it gets compressed! So for Instagram *1080p is key.*

**Facebook, Tumblr, etc.**

For most other social media websites, post the highest quality photo you have. They have very hard to achieve size constraints so it won't compress. If posting to your own webpage be weary because the larger the photo file, the longer it takes to load. 

**Conclusion**
So, generally, when wanting someone to see your artsy made digital images, upload the best possible quality photo in a format that does not compress the image, such as PNG.

If posting an image that has details to an event or something not meant for looking at but for reading, use JPEG or another format that compresses to save people time and space.
